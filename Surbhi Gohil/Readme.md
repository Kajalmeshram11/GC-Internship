# Google Search Scraper

This project contains a simple Python script that uses Selenium to scrape Google search results based on a user-provided query. The script retrieves and prints the titles of the search results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome )
- The corresponding WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone REPO_URL
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```

2. Navigate to your folder:

   ```bash
   cd YourName
   ```

3. Install the required Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

4. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and ensure it is in your system's PATH. For example, for Chrome, download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place it in a directory included in your PATH.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python selenium_to_scrape.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter your search query. The script will open a browser window, perform the search, and print the titles of the search results in the terminal.

## Example

```bash
Enter your search query: OpenAI
```

Output:
```
OpenAI: AI Research and Deployment
OpenAI - Wikipedia
OpenAI - GitHub
...
```
